# CTNet
### CTNet: A Convolutional Transformer Network for EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification [[Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71118-7)]
core idea: CNN (an improved version of EEGNet) + Transformer encoder 

Our research builds upon and improves the [EEG Conformer](https://github.com/eeyhsong/EEG-Conformer) and [EEG-ATCNet](https://github.com/Altaheri/EEG-ATCNet), and we sincerely thank the creators of these open-source project.

### Requirements:
Python 3.10

Pytorch 1.13.1
