### Abstract:
Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology bridges the direct communication between the brain and machines, unlocking new possibilities for human interaction and rehabilitation. EEG-based motor imagery (MI) plays a pivotal role in BCI, enabling the translation of thought into actionable commands for interactive and assistive technologies. However, the constrained decoding performance of brain signals poses a limitation to the broader application and development of BCI systems. In this study, we introduce a convolutional Transformer network (CTNet) designed for EEG-based MI classification. Firstly, CTNet employs a convolutional module analogous to EEGNet, dedicated to extracting local and spatial features from EEG time series. Subsequently, it incorporates a Transformer encoder module, leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism to discern the global dependencies of EEG's high-level features. Finally, a straightforward classifier module comprising fully connected layers is followed to categorize EEG signals. In subject-specific evaluations, CTNet achieved remarkable decoding accuracies of 82.52% and 88.49% on the BCI IV-2a and IV-2b datasets, respectively. Furthermore, in the challenging cross-subject assessments, CTNet achieved recognition accuracies of 58.64% on the BCI IV-2a dataset and 76.27% on the BCI IV-2b dataset. In both subject-specific and cross-subject evaluations, CTNet holds a leading position when compared to some of the state-of-the-art methods. This underscores the exceptional efficacy of our approach and its potential to set a new benchmark in EEG decoding.
